Directory Content Detection and Inspection Utility (DCDIU)

1. Project Overview

Directory Content Detection and Inspection Utility (DCDIU) is a client-server based system developed in C++ that enables secure scanning, inspection, and reporting of directory contents over a TCP/IP network.

The system consists of a centralized server and multiple clients. Clients submit directory paths and inspection requests, while the server processes, analyzes, and returns structured results.

Key responsibilities of the server include:

- Managing multiple concurrent client connections
- Authenticating connected clients
- Processing directory traversal requests
- Scanning and inspecting file contents
- Logging system activities
- Ensuring secure communication

Each client connects to the server using TCP sockets and interacts through a command-based interface.

3.2 Concurrency Model

- The server runs as a multi-threaded TCP server
- Each client connection is handled in a separate thread
- Shared resources are protected
- All processing is coordinated centrally

6. Build Instructions

6.1 Prerequisites

- Linux / WSL / macOS
- g++ (C++17 compatible)
- make
- OpenSSL Development Library

Install OpenSSL:

bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libssl-dev

6.2 Build

From the project root directory:

bash
make clean
make

This generates:

- build/server
- build/client

7. Running the Application

7.1 Start the Server

Open Terminal 1:

bash
./build/server

The server starts listening on the configured port.

7.2 Start Clients

Open Terminal 2 / Terminal 3:

bash
./build/client

Multiple clients can connect simultaneously.


8. How to Use the Application

This section describes the actual execution flow and output of the DCDIU system as observed during testing.

8.1 Starting the Client

Run the client application using:

bash
./build/client

On successful connection, the client prompts for registration or login.

Example:

Username: Mershika
Password: (Enter Your password)
Account created


This confirms that the authentication module is working correctly.


8.2 Main Menu

After login, the client displays the main menu

----------------------
    Display Menu
----------------------
1. Traverse
2. Search
3. Inspect
4. Exit

Users can select an option by entering the corresponding number.


8.3 Directory Traversal (Option 1)

When the user selects option 1 (Traverse), the system requests a directory path.

Example:

Choice: 1
Enter directory path: /home/student/25SUB4508


The server performs recursive traversal and sends the results to the client.

Sample Output:

Directory: /home/student/25SUB4508
Directory: /home/student/25SUB4508/25sub4508_56117
Directory: /home/student/25SUB4508/25sub4508_56117/Capstone
File: /home/student/.../Custom_system_call_using_Dockerfile_1_.pdf
File: /home/student/.../CA_SOFTWARE.pptx

This confirms successful directory scanning and file detection.

8.4 Search (Option 2)

Allows users to search for specific files or keywords within the selected directory.

Steps:
1. Select option 2
2. Enter search keyword
3. View matched results

8.5 Inspect (Option 3)

The Inspect feature analyzes selected files and displays detailed information such as size, type, and content patterns.

Steps:
1. Select option 3
2. Provide file or directory path
3. Review inspection report

8.6 Exit (Option 4)

Safely terminates the client session and disconnects from the server.

9. Client Commands

| Command   | Description                       |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|       |
| /exit     | Exit the client application       |

10. Logging & Observability

Log files are stored in:

-logs/username_pid.log

Logs include:

- Connection status
- Authentication attempts
- Scan requests
- Errors and warnings
- Session termination

11. Security Model

- Passwords are hashed using SHA-256
- OpenSSL is used for cryptographic support
- No plain-text password storage
- Secure session handling

12. Testing Summary

Testing includes:

- Functional testing (login, scan, logout)
- Negative testing (invalid paths, wrong login)
- Integration testing (multi-client usage)
- Log verification

All major modules were tested successfully.

13. Limitations & Future Enhancements

Current Limitations

- Single-server deployment
- Basic encryption
- Blocking I/O
- CLI-based interface

Future Enhancements

- TLS/SSL communication
- Distributed server architecture
- Database-backed user management
- Non-blocking I/O
- GUI client
- Advanced malware detection

14. Conclusion

DCDIU is a robust client-server based directory inspection framework built using modern C++ practices. It demonstrates networking, concurrency, security, and system-level programming concepts in a practical manner suitable for academic and professional evaluation.
